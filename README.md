# Lecturlyzer
Lecturlyzer is an AI-powered tool that transforms lecture audio into structured learning material. It transcribes speech to text using OpenAI Whisper, summarizes the content using a transformer-based model, and allows users to ask questions directly from the generated transcript â€” ensuring answers come only from the source, not generic AI output.
